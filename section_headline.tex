\par{
Junior engineer almost with a degree in micro electronics and computer science in l'Ã©cole des Mines de St-Etienne, in France. Following the embedded system major, I developed skills, knowledge and interest with real time kernel, internet of things and embedded system in general. The automotive field interests me as I studied it during both an industrial project and the internship I am currently finishing. I also followed Supply Chain Management classes letting me use the mathematics skills I earned during preparatory classes. I'm currently finishing an internship in Germany applying my skills and developping new devops skills.
